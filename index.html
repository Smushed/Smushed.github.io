                    I currently enrolled at Northwestern Coding Bootcamp in their August Stack. My expected graduation is March 2019. In addition to this I am currently working in accounting as an AP/AR Analyst for a trading firm in Chicago.
                    <br><br>
                    I currently live in the Lakeview district of Chicago and enjoy running, bike riding, weight lifting and reading. Prior to living in Chicago I went to school at University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee.
                    <br><br>
                    Going up in the Chicagoland I grew up a Bears fan but years of being a sub-par team have driven me to focus more on Fantasy Football, where I am just beginning my 10th year playing.
