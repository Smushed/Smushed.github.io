                I currently enrolled at Northwestern Coding Bootcamp in their August Stack. My expected graduation is March 2019. In addition to this I am currently working in accounting as an AP/AR Analyst for a trading firm in Chicago.
                <br><br>
                I currently live in the Lakeview district of Chicago and enjoy running, bike riding, weight lifting and reading. Right now I'm very much so looking forward to completing this bootcamp as well as Football season starting up.
                <br><br>
                Going up in the Chicagoland I grew up a Bears fan but years of being a sub-par team have driven me to focus more on Fantasy Football, where I am just beginning my 10th year playing.
