                                &emsp;My Name is Kevin Flerlage. I'm a native Chicagoian growing up and living here for 22 years.<br><br>
                                &emsp;Prior to becoming interested in coding I earned my Business Administration - Finance
                                degree studying at University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee. While attending classes I was the President of the German club as well as the Student Investment Club.<br><br>
                                &emsp;After graduating from college I moved back to Illinois and began my career in accounting as an Accounts Payable Specialist for a company in Addison.
                                At my first company I moved to a Financial Analyst role when I decided to move to the city work for my current employer Performance Trust.<br><br>
                                &emsp;Currently, I am enrolled in night classes at Northwestern in their full stack coding
                                bootcamp. At this course we are learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, MangoDB as well
                                as other tools to be successful in the technology field. It is my goal after this class
                                to move to a position focused in technology and software engineering. <br>
